  "name": "PIE Vulnerability",
  "description": "The binary is built without Position Independent Code flag. In order to prevent an attacker from reliably jumping to, for example, a particular exploited function in memory, Address space layout randomization (ASLR) randomly arranges the address space positions of key data areas of a process, including the base of the executable and the positions of the stack,heap and libraries.",
  "remediation": "Use compiler option `-fPIC` to enable Position Independent Code.",
